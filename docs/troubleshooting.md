## Difficulties to get the LF working properly

The LF antenna is on a second PCB attached to the main PCB via little screws which also serve as electric connection.
It has reported that on some devices the electric connection is not good, some glue or resin residues mai interfere.
You can try to dismantle very gently the screws and PCB, clean them and put them back in place.
Be very careful the screws have been reported to be quite fragile so be gentle with them!

## Difficulties to use BLE

After BLE pairing, both the phone and ChameleonUltra will save a secret key for encrypted communication. If either party deletes the pairing record, it will result in communication failure. If Bluetooth cannot be connected, clearing the pairing information on the other side can solve the problem:

* Find the Bluetooth settings in the phone's system settings and cancel pairing with the ChameleonUltra.
* In the CLI of ChameleonUltra, execute the `hw ble bonds clear` command to clear all pairing records.

Default BLE connect key(passkey) is `123456`

# DFU

## Communication issues between CLI and Chameleon

For example, typical error when performing DFU upgrade:

```
[00:00:00] ------   0% [id:9] Failed, [sdfu] [json.exception.type_error.302] type must be string, but is null
Error: One or more program tasks failed
```

Check the serial port permissions and if under Linux, make sure ModemManager is not interfering with your Chameleon.
The proposed [udev/rules.d file](../resource/driver/79-chameleon-usb-device-blacklist-dialout.rules) may help you (and add your user to the dialout group).

# CLI tools compilation

## ProxSpace: cmake error

The following error has been reported on some ProxSpace installations (why on some and not all is still unclear)

```
pm3 ~/ChameleonUltra/software/src$ cmake .
-- Building for: Ninja
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 10.3.0

CMake Error at C:/Users/moeya/Desktop/Chamelion/ProxSpace/msys2/mingw64/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/CMakeTestCCompiler.cmake:69 (message):
  The C compiler

    "C:/Users/xxx/ProxSpace/msys2/mingw64/bin/cc.exe"

  is not able to compile a simple test program.
```

This is due to a version of ninja not aware of the Windows paths. Fix:

```
pacman -R ninja --noconfirm
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja --noconfirm
```

# CLI usage

## InvalidException: Device unsupported cmd

You need to update the firmware of you Chameleon.
