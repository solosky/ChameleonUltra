Please keep in mind we are still at the infancy of the project and a lot has still to be done.

Have first a look at the [Whitepaper](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/ChameleonUltra/blob/main/docs/technical_whitepaper.md), the Wiki [Roadmap](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/ChameleonUltra/wiki/Public-Roadmap) and [Wishlist](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/ChameleonUltra/wiki/Wishlist).  
No need for creating issues for well known missing supports, we are already aware :)
